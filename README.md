# assignment2-Statistics-and-Trends
The analysis aimed at checking if there were relationships between economic indicators of a country,
such as the annual growth of GDP per capita, GNI per capita, inflation (GDP deflator), unemployment, urban population as a % of population and the total population.
I also wanted to see if these relationship was general for countries in the different continents and different levels for development, hence the random selection of the countries.
